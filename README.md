## ABSTRACT

Smart Glove for the Blind is an innovation with the help of multidisciplinary subjects like computer science, electronics engineering, and health science which helps blind people to navigate with speed and confidence by detecting nearby obstacles using the help of ultrasonic waves and notifying them with a buzzer sound or vibration. According to WHO The estimated number of people visually impaired in the world is 285 million, 39 million blind, and 246 million having low vision; 65 % of people visually impaired and 82% of all blind are 50 years and older. They are suffering a lot of hardships in their daily life. The affected ones have been using the traditional white cane for many years which although effective, still has a lot of disadvantages. This will be a wearable technology for the blinds. One of the main peculiarities of this device is that it will be affordable. The Arduino Uno board is worn like a device. This will be equipped with ultrasonic sensors, consisting of modules. Using the sensor, the visually impaired can detect the objects around them and can travel easily. When the sensor detects any object, it will notify the user by beep or vibration. Thus, this is an automated device. Thus, this device will be of great use for the blinds and help them travel to different places.

# CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION #
**1.1 	Introduction**

With the improvement of the expectations for everyday comforts of the individuals, we have become so materialistic that we have overlooked how the physically incapacitated individuals carry on with intense life. They experience thorough, emotionless, and uninterested conduct towards them for being physically incapacitated. They become reliant on other individuals in a manner for their everyday schedule errands. Daze and hindered people consistently rely upon others for their headway. The eyes are the prime feeling of an organ in seeing the outside condition; the brokenness of such a prime sense organ seriously impacts the information-seeing ability of the outside condition. Accordingly, heading over to places in such conditions is a major test because visually impaired individuals can't rely upon their very own eyes and in this manner face numerous challenges. The goal of this venture The Smart Glove for Visually Impaired People is to plan an item that is especially helpful to those individuals who are outwardly disabled and the individuals who frequently need to depend on others. Smart Glove for Dazzle venture is a development that helps the outwardly hindered individuals to start with one spot and then onto the next with speed and certainty by realizing the close by impediments utilizing the assistance of the wearable band which creates the ultrasonic waves which advise them with buzz sound or vibrations. It permits the client the individuals who are outwardly impeded walk unreservedly by recognizing the obstructions. The GMS module helps the impaired if he goes to an unknown place the user will press the switch and it will send a message to the user that I need help. As per WHO, 39 million individuals are evaluated as blinds around the world. They are enduring a ton of hardship in their day-to-day life. The physically handicapped ones have been utilizing the customary way that is the white stick for a long time which even though being compelling, still has a great deal of drawbacks and restrictions. Another way is, having a pet creature, for example, a canine, however, it is extremely costly. In this manner, the point of the venture Smart Glove for the Visually impaired is to build up a modest, reasonable, and increasingly productive approach to help the dazzle individuals explore with more noteworthy solace, speed, and certainty. This is the wearable innovation for the blinds which helps settle every one of the issues of the current advancements. Presently a day there are such huge numbers of innovations, things, and keen gadgets for the outwardly debilitated individuals for the route, however, the majority of them have certain issues for the dazzled individuals and the significant downsides are that those things quirk this advancement is, it is moderate for everybody, the all-out cost being under 4000 to 5000 Taka. There are no such gadgets accessible in the market that can be worn like a fabric and have such minimal effort and effortlessness. With the utilization of this extemporized gadget on a huge scale, with upgrades in the model, it will profit the network of the outwardly impeded or the visually impaired individuals. The strolling stick is a basic and mechanical gadget devoted to recognizing the static or the steady snags on the ground, lopsided surfaces, openings, and steps using straight forward material power input. This gadget is light, and convenient yet constrained to its size and it isn't utilized for dynamic impediment recognition. These gadgets work like the radar and the arrangement of the gadget utilizes the ultrasonic wave’s fascicle to recognize the stature, bearing, and the speed of the articles. The separation between the individual and the hindrance is estimated when the wave travels. 
   
**1.2 	Motivation**

The idea was inspired by bats, which also use sound waves of high frequency to move. According to an estimate, there are 285 million visually impaired people in the world. The loss of one, of the most important human senses causes them a lot of hardships in daily life. We have designed a special wearable device based on the Arduino board which can be worn like a cloth for blinds. This device is equipped with five ultrasonic sensors, consisting of a module that is connected to the hand of a human body. Using the ultrasonic sensor, blind people can detect the objects in a dimensional view around them and can easily travel anywhere. When the ultrasonic sensor detects an obstacle, the device will notify the user through vibrations and sound beeps. However, all the existing systems inform the blind of the presence of the object at a specific distance in front of or near him. These details help the user or the blind people in detecting the obstacles and thus change the way and walk accordingly. Information about the objects and their place in the way of walking like an obstacle and their characteristics can create additional knowledge to enhance the space manifestation and memory of the blind or the visually impaired people. When used on a large scale, with improvements in the prototype, it will drastically benefit the community.    
  
**1.3 	Objectives**

The objective of this project The Smart Glove for the Blind is to design a product that is very much useful to those people who are visually impaired and those who often have to rely on others. Smart Glove for Blind project is an innovation that helps visually impaired people to move around and go from one place to another with speed and confidence by knowing the nearby obstacles using the help of the wearable band which produces ultrasonic waves which notify them with buzz sounds or vibrations. It allows the user those who are visually impaired to walk freely by detecting obstacles. They only need to wear this device as a band or cloth on their body. This device is light and portable but limited in its size and it is not used for dynamic obstacle detection. These devices operate like radar and the system of the device uses the ultrasonic wave fascicle to identify the height, direction, and speed of the objects. The distance between the person and the obstacle is measured by the time of the wave travel. However, all the existing systems inform the blind of the presence of the object at a specific distance in front of or near him. These details help the user or the blind people in detecting the obstacles and thus change the way and walk accordingly. Information about the objects and their place in the way of walking like an obstacle and their characteristics can create additional knowledge to enhance the space manifestation and memory of the blind or the visually impaired people. To survive the previously mentioned constraints this work offers a basic, productive, configurable virtual for the visually impaired. 
The project has some objectives in a wide variety of areas such as:

❖	_To design and construct a smart device for visual impaired people._ 
❖	_To develop new ways of interfacing with visually impaired people._
❖	_To move safely and independently without white cane and help of others._
❖	_To avoid collision with obstacles on the way._
 
**1.4 	Purpose of The Project**

The purpose of this project is Smart glove for the Blind is to design a product which is very much useful to those people who are visually impaired and those who often have to rely on others. The smart glove for Blind project is an innovation which helps the blind person to move around and go from one place to another with speed and confidence by knowing the nearby obstacles using the help of the wearable band which produces the ultrasonic waves which notify them with buzz sound or vibrations. It allows the user those who are visually impaired to walk freely by detecting the obstacles. They only need to wear this device as a band or cloth on their body.

# CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW #

**2.1 Review of The Related Study**

Over the last few years or we can say over the last decades, research has been conducted for new devices and technologies to design a good reliable and efficient system for blind or visually impaired people to detect obstacles and warn or alert them at dangerous places or the obstacles. There are some systems which have some limitations and clampdowns. Shoval et al. in developed a NavBelt, an obstacle avoidance wearable portable computer that is only for indoor navigation. NavBelt was equipped with two modes, in the first one the system information was translated to audio in different sounds. One sound for free for travel direction and the other for blocked, it was difficult for the person to differentiate the sounds. Another problem was the system would not know the user's momentary position.

**2.2 Review of The Existing System**

D. Yuan et al discussed the virtual white cane sensing device based on active triangulation that can measure distances at a rate of 15 measurements/second. A blind person can use this device to sense the environment, pointing it as if it were a flashlight. Besides measuring distances, this device can detect surface discontinuities, such as the foot of a wall, a step, or a drop-off. This is obtained by analyzing the range data collected as the user swings the device around, tracking planar patches, and finding discontinuities. 
Benjamin discussed laser cane with three photodiodes and three laser diodes function as a receiver making an optical triangulation. The laser can generally detect the obstacle in three specified directions. One is 45º to the ground for overhanging obstacles, the second one is parallel to the ground, and the third one is for sharp deepness. The laser cane has no data or technology or we can say a system for determining the location and the position of the obstacle, rather it is just like a hitand-trial method. J. Na proposed an interactive guide system for indoor positioning this, which can’t detect obstacles and hurdles. The system is not suitable for outdoor activities. Sin has described the development of a navigation aid in order to assist blind and visually impaired people to navigate easily, and safely to detect any obstacles. The system is based on a microcontroller with synthetic speech output. In addition to this, the device consists of two vibrators, two ultrasonic sensors that are mounted on the user’s shoulders or any other body part, and another one integrated into the cane. An Unger S. has proposed methods for visually impaired people in urban cities. But they didn’t consider the people who cannot afford costly equipment and devices. This limitation is overcome by the device Smart Glove for the blind. Ms. Pooja Sharma [6] has discussed that the obstacles can be detected, but it has many limitations on the angles and the distance. On the contrary, this project will have a wide angle for the detection where the sensor range will be wide.

Likewise Guide Cane, invention also has a control button on the handle, and the button has four different directions. This invention of the Smart Glove for blind has the same shortcomings or limitations as the Guide Cane where there will be difficulty to save space for the cane or to place the smart cane like the other. Other than that, cost is also a problem in this project as it uses ultrasonic sensors and many servo motors. If the cost is high, users may not be able to afford it because the average income of visually impaired people is usually less. Smart Cane has been designed by students from Central Michigan University where this invention uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). RFID is used to detect objects or obstacles in front of the user and detects the RFID tag that has been placed in several locations to navigate the users. This invention is just like a normal stick but is provided with a bag, which the user can wear. The bag provides electrical power to the invention and informs the user through speakers inside the bag. For users who cannot hear, there are special gloves that will vibrate at every finger, with which different vibrations in each finger have different meanings. However, this invention has several shortcomings and is only suitable for small areas. This is because it only detects the area with an RFID tag otherwise this invention only works as a regular blind cane. 
 
**2.3 Problem of The Existing Systems**

In today’s world of innovations, there are many innovations for the visually impaired people like the white cane with the cane with a red tip for helping the movements of the blind people.

There are many different types of canes used in today’s world with growing technologies such as the white cane, the smart cane, and the laser cane. White cane may easily crack/break, the stick may get stuck at pavement cracks of different objects. The biggest problem is that people assume that having a white cane means that you are fully blind. This is not true. There are many degrees of blindness and many reasons to need a white cane. All the problems mentioned here are already covered. Silent electric cars, objects like trees, or signs that my white cane cannot find. Construction sites are a problem as they can be dangerous. I live in a place with hardly any sidewalks.

Guide dogs generally only work for 6-8 years. Even though you don’t want them to age, they still do. Handlers need to work diligently to maintain their dog’s training. This includes working with the dog every day; and reinforcing obedience, rules, and good behaviors. Even though the dogs are well-trained, they are still dogs and will occasionally do something naughty. Dogs get sick, and their veterinary expenses are not cheap. Other expenses include high-quality dog food, durable dog toys, grooming supplies, and extra working gear (like a raincoat and protective boots, for some). Maintaining a daily schedule for feeding, watering, relieving, playing, and grooming is essential but can be difficult. Handlers will need to plan for late evenings, overnight trips, and vacations. There are some places where handlers may decide not to take their guide dog. This can include movie theaters with sticky floors, loud concerts, amusement parks, and certain foreign countries that do not have disability access laws. The cost of the trained dogs is also very high and is not an affordable option. A survey found that the remote guidance system is very difficult to carry and thus the wearable band will be a more optimized version.

❖	_White cane - May easily crack/break, the stick may get stuck at pavement cracks of different objects._

❖	_Guide dog - huge cost. (34,00,000 - 50,00,000 Taka)_

❖	_Common Disadvantages (Including the smart devices) Cannot be carried easily, needs a lot of training to use._

 
**2.4 The Features of Smart Gloves for Visually Impaired People**

By wearing this device, they can fully avoid the use of white cane and other devices. This device will help the blind to navigate without holding a stick which is a bit annoying for them. They can simply wear it as a band or cloth and it can function very accurately and they only need a very little training to use it.

Smart gloves for Blind people using Microcontroller and GPS is an innovation that helps the visually impaired people to move around and go from one place to another with speed and confidence by knowing the obstacles which come on the way, by using the wearable hand gloves which produce the ultrasonic waves and notify them with buzz sound as well as vibrations. It helps people who are visually impaired to walk comfortably by detecting obstacles. They only need to wear this device as a band or hand gloves. Uses the Ultrasonic ranging method to detect nearby obstacles such as walls, tables, doors, chairs, and other furniture. The user gets notified about obstacles through sound and vibration. The intensity of vibration and rate of beeping increases with a decrease in distance. The device only reacts when the trigger buttons are pressed.
 	 
**2.5 Overview of The Proposed System**

The proposed system deals with cheaper and more effective obstacle detection with a wide range of coverage. The device includes the following components Arduino UNO, Ultrasonic sensor, Bread board, Buzzer, 5 mm LED: Red, Slide Switch, Female Header, Male Header, Jumper wires, Power bank, Some elastics, and stickers. This is the first wearable technology for blinds that resolves all the problems of existing technologies. Nowadays there are so many instruments and smart devices for visually impaired people for navigation but most of them have certain problems with carrying and the major drawback is those need a lot of training to use. One of the main peculiarity of this innovation is, that it is affordable for everyone, the total cost being less than $25 (~2000BDT). There are no such devices available in the market that can be worn like a cloth and have such a low cost and simplicity.

**3.3 Circuit Diagram of the System:**

**3.4 Arduino UNO**

The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Arduino UNO microcontroller and developed by Arduino. cc. The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced with various expansion boards (shields) and other circuits. The board has 14 digital I/O pins (six capable of PWM output), and 6 analog I/O pins, and is programmable with the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), via a type B USB cable.

It can be powered by the USB cable or by an external 9-volt battery, though it accepts voltages between 7 and 20 volts. It is similar to the Arduino Nano and Leonardo. The hardware reference design is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 2.5 license and is available on the Arduino website. Layout and production files for some versions of the hardware are also available.

The word "no" means "one" in Italian and was chosen to mark the initial release of Arduino Software. The Uno board is the first in a series of USB-based Arduino boards; it and version 1.0 of the Arduino IDE were the reference versions of Arduino, which have now evolved to newer releases. The ATmega328 on the board comes preprogrammed with a bootloader that allows uploading new code to it without the use of an external hardware programmer.  Here we are using Arduino UNO, It will receive the signals from the us sensors and it is an open-source hardware board and we will upload a program into the Arduino which is used for impaired people through USB.

**3.6 Ultrasonic Sensor**

An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal. Ultrasonic waves travel faster than the speed of audible sound (i.e. the sound that humans can hear). Ultrasonic sensors have two main components: the transmitter (which emits the sound using piezoelectric crystals) and the receiver (which encounters the sound after it has travelled to and from the target).

To calculate the distance between the sensor and the object, the sensor measures the time it takes between the emission of the sound by the transmitter to its contact with the receiver. The formula for this calculation is D = ½ T x C (where D is the distance, T is the time, and C is the speed of sound ~ 343 meters/second). For example, if a scientist set up an ultrasonic sensor aimed at a box and it took 0.025 seconds for the sound to bounce back, the distance between the ultrasonic sensor and the box would be D = 0.5 x 0.025 x 343 or about 4.2875 meters. In request to give the impediment evasion, an Ultrasonic sensor is utilized. Ultrasonic going gives 2cm-400cm non-contact estimation work, the running exactness can reach to 3 mm. It consolidates ultrasonic transmitters, beneficiary, and control circuits. Ultrasonic use I/O trigger for in any event 10us significant level sign.

Sensor consequently sends eight 40 KHz and perceives whether there is a heartbeat signal back. If the sign back, through raised level, time of high return I/O length is the time from sending ultrasonic to returning.
 
**3.7	Buzzer**

A buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric (piezo for short). Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, timers, and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke. These devices will be used to give the signals to the impaired person. The buzzer will give an alarm sound when the object is near.

**3.8 	Vibration Motor**

Vibration motor is a compact size coreless DC motor used to inform the users of receiving the signal by vibrating, no sound. Vibration motors are widely used in a variety of applications including cell phones, handsets, pagers, and so on. The main features of vibration motor are the magnet coreless DC motor are permanent, which means it will always have its magnetic properties (unlike an electromagnet, which only behaves like a magnet when an electric current runs through it); another main feature is the size of the motor itself is small, and thus light weight. Moreover, the noise and the power consumption that the motor produces while using are low. Based on those features, the performance of the motor is highly reliable. The vibration motors are configured. We will use this device for giving the signals to the impaired person. Vibration motor collects the distance data of obstacles from the Arduino. It increases its vibration when the distance decreases.

**3.9 Power Supply**

A power supply is an electrical device that supplies electric power to an electrical load. The primary function of a power supply is to convert electric current from a source to the correct voltage, current, and frequency to power the load. As a result, power supplies are sometimes referred to as electric power converters. Some power supplies are separate standalone pieces of equipment, while others are built into the load appliances that they power.

Examples of the latter include power supplies found in desktop computers and consumer electronics devices. Other functions that power supplies may perform include limiting the current drawn by the load to safe levels, shutting off the current in the event of an electrical fault, power conditioning to prevent electronic noise or voltage surges on the input from reaching the load, power-factor correction, and storing energy so it can continue to power the load in the event of a temporary interruption in the source power. Since all electronic circuits work only with the low dc voltage. We need a power supply unit to give the fitting voltage supply. This unit comprises battery, rectifier, filter and guideline. 
 
**3.10 LED**

A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons. The color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photons) is determined by the energy required for electrons to cross the band gap of the semiconductor. White light is obtained by using multiple semiconductors or a layer of light emitting phosphor on the semiconductor device.

Appearing as practical electronic components in 1962, the earliest LEDs emitted low intensity infrared light. Infrared LEDs are used in remote-control circuits, such as those used with a wide variety of consumer electronics. The first visible-light LEDs were of low intensity and limited to red. Modern LEDs are available across the visible, ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with high light output.

Early LEDs were often used as indicator lamps, replacing small incandescent bulbs, and in seven-segment displays. Recent developments have produced high-output white light LEDs suitable for room and outdoor area lighting. LEDs have led to new displays and sensors, while their high switching rates are useful in advanced communications technology.   
LEDs have many advantages over incandescent light sources, including lower energy consumption, longer lifetime, improved physical robustness, smaller size, and faster switching. LEDs are used in applications as diverse as aviation lighting, automotive headlamps, advertising, general lighting, traffic signals, camera flashes, lighted wallpaper, plant growing light and medical devices. 
  
**3.11 Resistors**

A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses.

Electronic symbols for a resistor. The top is the American version. The bottom is the International Electro-Technical Commission version. The resistor is a fundamental electrical component in physical circuits as well as circuit analysis and equivalent circuits.  It was the earliest electrical attribute - identified shortly after the electrical current was discovered. All materials exhibit some form of resistance, some are greater than others, eg. copper, aluminum, and gold are considered good conductors (low resistance), stainless steel, carbon, and tungsten are average conductors (medium resistance), and then ceramics, mica, and air are considered poor conductors (high resistance).

Ohm's Law defines the relationship between circuit attributes:

Resistance = Volts / Current

Resistance = Power / (Current^2)

A non-ohmic attribute of Resistance can also be defined as a function of noise voltage, as part of Noise Power = kTBf, where a resistor that is above absolute zero temperature is a source of noise.  When a resistor is combined with either a capacitor or inductor, the current through this network will be out of phase with the applied voltage, and described as displacement current. The combination of resistance with capacitance/inductance is known as impedance and complex mathematics is used to build on the basic ohm’s law shown above. 
 
**3.12 Wire**

A wire is a single, usually cylindrical, flexible strand or rod of metal. Wires are used to bear mechanical loads or electricity and telecommunications signals. Wire is commonly formed by drawing the metal through a hole in a die or draw plate. Wire gauges come in various standard sizes, as expressed in terms of a gauge number. The term wire is also used more loosely to refer to a bundle of such strands, as in "multistranded wire", which is more correctly termed a wire rope in mechanics, or a cable in electricity.

**3.13 Glove**

All hardware parts are stitching and installing above fabric gloves that wore by users, it shown in Figure.
