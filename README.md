## ABSTRACT

Smart Glove for the Blind is an innovation with the help of multidisciplinary subjects like computer science, electronics engineering, and health science which helps blind people to navigate with speed and confidence by detecting nearby obstacles using the help of ultrasonic waves and notifying them with a buzzer sound or vibration. According to WHO The estimated number of people visually impaired in the world is 285 million, 39 million blind, and 246 million having low vision; 65 % of people visually impaired and 82% of all blind are 50 years and older. They are suffering a lot of hardships in their daily life. The affected ones have been using the traditional white cane for many years which although effective, still has a lot of disadvantages. This will be a wearable technology for the blinds. One of the main peculiarities of this device is that it will be affordable. The Arduino Uno board is worn like a device. This will be equipped with ultrasonic sensors, consisting of modules. Using the sensor, the visually impaired can detect the objects around them and can travel easily. When the sensor detects any object, it will notify the user by beep or vibration. Thus, this is an automated device. Thus, this device will be of great use for the blinds and help them travel to different places.

# CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION #
**1.1 	Introduction**

With the improvement of the expectations for everyday comforts of the individuals, we have become so materialistic that we have overlooked how the physically incapacitated individuals carry on with intense life. They experience thorough, emotionless, and uninterested conduct towards them for being physically incapacitated. They become reliant on other individuals in a manner for their everyday schedule errands. Daze and hindered people consistently rely upon others for their headway. The eyes are the prime feeling of an organ in seeing the outside condition; the brokenness of such a prime sense organ seriously impacts the information-seeing ability of the outside condition. Accordingly, heading over to places in such conditions is a major test because visually impaired individuals can't rely upon their very own eyes and in this manner face numerous challenges. The goal of this venture The Smart Glove for Visually Impaired People is to plan an item that is especially helpful to those individuals who are outwardly disabled and the individuals who frequently need to depend on others. Smart Glove for Dazzle venture is a development that helps the outwardly hindered individuals to start with one spot and then onto the next with speed and certainty by realizing the close by impediments utilizing the assistance of the wearable band which creates the ultrasonic waves which advise them with buzz sound or vibrations. It permits the client the individuals who are outwardly impeded walk unreservedly by recognizing the obstructions. The GMS module helps the impaired if he goes to an unknown place the user will press the switch and it will send a message to the user that I need help. As per WHO, 39 million individuals are evaluated as blinds around the world. They are enduring a ton of hardship in their day-to-day life. The physically handicapped ones have been utilizing the customary way that is the white stick for a long time which even though being compelling, still has a great deal of drawbacks and restrictions. Another way is, having a pet creature, for example, a canine, however, it is extremely costly. In this manner, the point of the venture Smart Glove for the Visually impaired is to build up a modest, reasonable, and increasingly productive approach to help the dazzle individuals explore with more noteworthy solace, speed, and certainty. This is the wearable innovation for the blinds which helps settle every one of the issues of the current advancements. Presently a day there are such huge numbers of innovations, things, and keen gadgets for the outwardly debilitated individuals for the route, however, the majority of them have certain issues for the dazzled individuals and the significant downsides are that those things quirk this advancement is, it is moderate for everybody, the all-out cost being under 4000 to 5000 Taka. There are no such gadgets accessible in the market that can be worn like a fabric and have such minimal effort and effortlessness. With the utilization of this extemporized gadget on a huge scale, with upgrades in the model, it will profit the network of the outwardly impeded or the visually impaired individuals. The strolling stick is a basic and mechanical gadget devoted to recognizing the static or the steady snags on the ground, lopsided surfaces, openings, and steps using straight forward material power input. This gadget is light, and convenient yet constrained to its size and it isn't utilized for dynamic impediment recognition. These gadgets work like the radar and the arrangement of the gadget utilizes the ultrasonic wave’s fascicle to recognize the stature, bearing, and the speed of the articles. The separation between the individual and the hindrance is estimated when the wave travels. 
   
**1.2 	Motivation**

The idea was inspired by bats, which also use sound waves of high frequency to move. According to an estimate, there are 285 million visually impaired people in the world. The loss of one, of the most important human senses causes them a lot of hardships in daily life. We have designed a special wearable device based on the Arduino board which can be worn like a cloth for blinds. This device is equipped with five ultrasonic sensors, consisting of a module that is connected to the hand of a human body. Using the ultrasonic sensor, blind people can detect the objects in a dimensional view around them and can easily travel anywhere. When the ultrasonic sensor detects an obstacle, the device will notify the user through vibrations and sound beeps. However, all the existing systems inform the blind of the presence of the object at a specific distance in front of or near him. These details help the user or the blind people in detecting the obstacles and thus change the way and walk accordingly. Information about the objects and their place in the way of walking like an obstacle and their characteristics can create additional knowledge to enhance the space manifestation and memory of the blind or the visually impaired people. When used on a large scale, with improvements in the prototype, it will drastically benefit the community.    
  
**1.3 	Objectives**

The objective of this project The Smart Glove for the Blind is to design a product that is very much useful to those people who are visually impaired and those who often have to rely on others. Smart Glove for Blind project is an innovation that helps visually impaired people to move around and go from one place to another with speed and confidence by knowing the nearby obstacles using the help of the wearable band which produces ultrasonic waves which notify them with buzz sounds or vibrations. It allows the user those who are visually impaired to walk freely by detecting obstacles. They only need to wear this device as a band or cloth on their body. This device is light and portable but limited in its size and it is not used for dynamic obstacle detection. These devices operate like radar and the system of the device uses the ultrasonic wave fascicle to identify the height, direction, and speed of the objects. The distance between the person and the obstacle is measured by the time of the wave travel. However, all the existing systems inform the blind of the presence of the object at a specific distance in front of or near him. These details help the user or the blind people in detecting the obstacles and thus change the way and walk accordingly. Information about the objects and their place in the way of walking like an obstacle and their characteristics can create additional knowledge to enhance the space manifestation and memory of the blind or the visually impaired people. To survive the previously mentioned constraints this work offers a basic, productive, configurable virtual for the visually impaired. 
The project has some objectives in a wide variety of areas such as:

❖	_To design and construct a smart device for visual impaired people._ 
❖	_To develop new ways of interfacing with visually impaired people._
❖	_To move safely and independently without white cane and help of others._
❖	_To avoid collision with obstacles on the way._
 
**1.4 	Purpose of The Project**

The purpose of this project is Smart glove for the Blind is to design a product which is very much useful to those people who are visually impaired and those who often have to rely on others. The smart glove for Blind project is an innovation which helps the blind person to move around and go from one place to another with speed and confidence by knowing the nearby obstacles using the help of the wearable band which produces the ultrasonic waves which notify them with buzz sound or vibrations. It allows the user those who are visually impaired to walk freely by detecting the obstacles. They only need to wear this device as a band or cloth on their body. Thus, this project Arduino based obstacle detector for blind people is a new method to resolve their problems. A less complex portable, cost efficient, easy to manage an effective system with many more amazing properties and advantages are proposed to provide support for the blind. The system will be very easy to find the distance between the objects and the sensor. It can detect the objects in every direction the blind person. Without the help of others, the blind person can move from one place to other and lead their regular lives independently.

# CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW #

**2.1 Review of The Related Study**

Over the last few years or we can say over the last decades, research has been conducted for new devices and technologies to design a good reliable and efficient system for blind or visually impaired people to detect obstacles and warn or alert them at dangerous places or the obstacles. There are some systems which have some limitations and clampdowns. Shoval et al. in developed a NavBelt, an obstacle avoidance wearable portable computer that is only for indoor navigation. NavBelt was equipped with two modes, in the first one the system information was translated to audio in different sounds. One sound for free for travel direction and the other for blocked, it was difficult for the person to differentiate the sounds. Another problem was the system would not know the user's momentary position.

**2.2 Review of The Existing System**

D. Yuan et al discussed the virtual white cane sensing device based on active triangulation that can measure distances at a rate of 15 measurements/second. A blind person can use this device to sense the environment, pointing it as if it were a flashlight. Besides measuring distances, this device can detect surface discontinuities, such as the foot of a wall, a step, or a drop-off. This is obtained by analyzing the range data collected as the user swings the device around, tracking planar patches, and finding discontinuities. 
Benjamin discussed laser cane with three photodiodes and three laser diodes function as a receiver making an optical triangulation. The laser can generally detect the obstacle in three specified directions. One is 45º to the ground for overhanging obstacles, the second one is parallel to the ground, and the third one is for sharp deepness. The laser cane has no data or technology or we can say a system for determining the location and the position of the obstacle, rather it is just like a hitand-trial method. J. Na proposed an interactive guide system for indoor positioning this, which can’t detect obstacles and hurdles. The system is not suitable for outdoor activities. Sin has described the development of a navigation aid in order to assist blind and visually impaired people to navigate easily, and safely to detect any obstacles. The system is based on a microcontroller with synthetic speech output. In addition to this, the device consists of two vibrators, two ultrasonic sensors that are mounted on the user’s shoulders or any other body part, and another one integrated into the cane. An Unger S. has proposed methods for visually impaired people in urban cities. But they didn’t consider the people who cannot afford costly equipment and devices. This limitation is overcome by the device Smart Glove for the blind. Ms. Pooja Sharma [6] has discussed that the obstacles can be detected, but it has many limitations on the angles and the distance. On the contrary, this project will have a wide angle for the detection where the sensor range will be wide.

Likewise Guide Cane, invention also has a control button on the handle, and the button has four different directions. This invention of the Smart Glove for blind has the same shortcomings or limitations as the Guide Cane where there will be difficulty to save space for the cane or to place the smart cane like the other. Other than that, cost is also a problem in this project as it uses ultrasonic sensors and many servo motors. If the cost is high, users may not be able to afford it because the average income of visually impaired people is usually less. Smart Cane has been designed by students from Central Michigan University where this invention uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). RFID is used to detect objects or obstacles in front of the user and detects the RFID tag that has been placed in several locations to navigate the users. This invention is just like a normal stick but is provided with a bag, which the user can wear. The bag provides electrical power to the invention and informs the user through speakers inside the bag. For users who cannot hear, there are special gloves that will vibrate at every finger, with which different vibrations in each finger have different meanings. However, this invention has several shortcomings and is only suitable for small areas. This is because it only detects the area with an RFID tag otherwise this invention only works as a regular blind cane. 
 
**2.3 Problem of The Existing Systems**

In today’s world of innovations, there are many innovations for the visually impaired people like the white cane with the cane with a red tip for helping the movements of the blind people.

There are many different types of canes used in today’s world with growing technologies such as the white cane, the smart cane, and the laser cane. White cane may easily crack/break, the stick may get stuck at pavement cracks of different objects. The biggest problem is that people assume that having a white cane means that you are fully blind. This is not true. There are many degrees of blindness and many reasons to need a white cane. All the problems mentioned here are already covered. Silent electric cars, objects like trees, or signs that my white cane cannot find. Construction sites are a problem as they can be dangerous. I live in a place with hardly any sidewalks.

Guide dogs generally only work for 6-8 years. Even though you don’t want them to age, they still do. Handlers need to work diligently to maintain their dog’s training. This includes working with the dog every day; and reinforcing obedience, rules, and good behaviors. Even though the dogs are well-trained, they are still dogs and will occasionally do something naughty. Dogs get sick, and their veterinary expenses are not cheap. Other expenses include high-quality dog food, durable dog toys, grooming supplies, and extra working gear (like a raincoat and protective boots, for some). Maintaining a daily schedule for feeding, watering, relieving, playing, and grooming is essential but can be difficult. Handlers will need to plan for late evenings, overnight trips, and vacations. There are some places where handlers may decide not to take their guide dog. This can include movie theaters with sticky floors, loud concerts, amusement parks, and certain foreign countries that do not have disability access laws. The cost of the trained dogs is also very high and is not an affordable option. A survey found that the remote guidance system is very difficult to carry and thus the wearable band will be a more optimized version.

❖	_White cane - May easily crack/break, the stick may get stuck at pavement cracks of different objects._

❖	_Guide dog - huge cost. (34,00,000 - 50,00,000 Taka)_

❖	_Common Disadvantages (Including the smart devices) Cannot be carried easily, needs a lot of training to use._

 
**2.4 The Features of Smart Gloves for Visually Impaired People**

By wearing this device, they can fully avoid the use of white cane and other devices. This device will help the blind to navigate without holding a stick which is a bit annoying for them. They can simply wear it as a band or cloth and it can function very accurately and they only need a very little training to use it.

Smart gloves for Blind people using Microcontroller and GPS is an innovation that helps the visually impaired people to move around and go from one place to another with speed and confidence by knowing the obstacles which come on the way, by using the wearable hand gloves which produce the ultrasonic waves and notify them with buzz sound as well as vibrations. It helps people who are visually impaired to walk comfortably by detecting obstacles. They only need to wear this device as a band or hand gloves. Uses the Ultrasonic ranging method to detect nearby obstacles such as walls, tables, doors, chairs, and other furniture. The user gets notified about obstacles through sound and vibration. The intensity of vibration and rate of beeping increases with a decrease in distance. The device only reacts when the trigger buttons are pressed.
 	 
**2.5 Overview of The Proposed System**

The proposed system deals with cheaper and more effective obstacle detection with a wide range of coverage. The device includes the following components Arduino UNO, Ultrasonic sensor, Bread board, Buzzer, 5 mm LED: Red, Slide Switch, Female Header, Male Header, Jumper wires, Power bank, Some elastics, and stickers. This is the first wearable technology for blinds that resolves all the problems of existing technologies. Nowadays there are so many instruments and smart devices for visually impaired people for navigation but most of them have certain problems with carrying and the major drawback is those need a lot of training to use. One of the main peculiarity of this innovation is, that it is affordable for everyone, the total cost being less than $25 (~2000BDT). There are no such devices available in the market that can be worn like a cloth and have such a low cost and simplicity.

**3.6 Ultrasonic Sensor**

An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal. Ultrasonic waves travel faster than the speed of audible sound (i.e. the sound that humans can hear). Ultrasonic sensors have two main components: the transmitter (which emits the sound using piezoelectric crystals) and the receiver (which encounters the sound after it has travelled to and from the target).

To calculate the distance between the sensor and the object, the sensor measures the time it takes between the emission of the sound by the transmitter to its contact with the receiver. The formula for this calculation is D = ½ T x C (where D is the distance, T is the time, and C is the speed of sound ~ 343 meters/second). For example, if a scientist set up an ultrasonic sensor aimed at a box and it took 0.025 seconds for the sound to bounce back, the distance between the ultrasonic sensor and the box would be D = 0.5 x 0.025 x 343 or about 4.2875 meters. In request to give the impediment evasion, an Ultrasonic sensor is utilized. Ultrasonic going gives 2cm-400cm non-contact estimation work, the running exactness can reach to 3 mm. It consolidates ultrasonic transmitters, beneficiary, and control circuits. Ultrasonic use I/O trigger for in any event 10us significant level sign.

Fig 3.6: Ultrasonic Sensor

Sensor consequently sends eight 40 KHz and perceives whether there is a heartbeat signal back. If the sign back, through raised level, time of high return I/O length is the time from sending ultrasonic to returning.
 
**3.7	Buzzer**

A buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric (piezo for short). Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, timers, and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke. These devices will be used to give the signals to the impaired person. The buzzer will give an alarm sound when the object is near.

Fig 3.7: Buzzer

**3.8 	Vibration Motor**

Vibration motor is a compact size coreless DC motor used to inform the users of receiving the signal by vibrating, no sound. Vibration motors are widely used in a variety of applications including cell phones, handsets, pagers, and so on. The main features of vibration motor are the magnet coreless DC motor are permanent, which means it will always have its magnetic properties (unlike an electromagnet, which only behaves like a magnet when an electric current runs through it); another main feature is the size of the motor itself is small, and thus light weight. Moreover, the noise and the power consumption that the motor produces while using are low. Based on those features, the performance of the motor is highly reliable. The vibration motors are configured. We will use this device for giving the signals to the impaired person. Vibration motor collects the distance data of obstacles from the Arduino. It increases its vibration when the distance decreases.

Fig 3.8: Vibration motor

**3.9 Power Supply**

A power supply is an electrical device that supplies electric power to an electrical load. The primary function of a power supply is to convert electric current from a source to the correct voltage, current, and frequency to power the load. As a result, power supplies are sometimes referred to as electric power converters. Some power supplies are separate standalone pieces of equipment, while others are built into the load appliances that they power.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa09281c-7a84-488d-b566-025290d678e0)

Fig 3.9: Power Supply

Examples of the latter include power supplies found in desktop computers and consumer electronics devices. Other functions that power supplies may perform include limiting the current drawn by the load to safe levels, shutting off the current in the event of an electrical fault, power conditioning to prevent electronic noise or voltage surges on the input from reaching the load, power-factor correction, and storing energy so it can continue to power the load in the event of a temporary interruption in the source power. Since all electronic circuits work only with the low dc voltage. We need a power supply unit to give the fitting voltage supply. This unit comprises battery, rectifier, filter and guideline. 
 
**3.10 LED**

A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons. The color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photons) is determined by the energy required for electrons to cross the band gap of the semiconductor. White light is obtained by using multiple semiconductors or a layer of light emitting phosphor on the semiconductor device.

Fig 3.10: LED


Appearing as practical electronic components in 1962, the earliest LEDs emitted low intensity infrared light. Infrared LEDs are used in remote-control circuits, such as those used with a wide variety of consumer electronics. The first visible-light LEDs were of low intensity and limited to red. Modern LEDs are available across the visible, ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with high light output.

Early LEDs were often used as indicator lamps, replacing small incandescent bulbs, and in seven-segment displays. Recent developments have produced high-output white light LEDs suitable for room and outdoor area lighting. LEDs have led to new displays and sensors, while their high switching rates are useful in advanced communications technology.   
LEDs have many advantages over incandescent light sources, including lower energy consumption, longer lifetime, improved physical robustness, smaller size, and faster switching. LEDs are used in applications as diverse as aviation lighting, automotive headlamps, advertising, general lighting, traffic signals, camera flashes, lighted wallpaper, plant growing light and medical devices. 
  
**3.11 Resistors**

A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses.

Fig 3.11: Resistor



Electronic symbols for a resistor. The top is the American version. The bottom is the International Electro-Technical Commission version. The resistor is a fundamental electrical component in physical circuits as well as circuit analysis and equivalent circuits.  It was the earliest electrical attribute - identified shortly after the electrical current was discovered. All materials exhibit some form of resistance, some are greater than others, eg. copper, aluminum, and gold are considered good conductors (low resistance), stainless steel, carbon, and tungsten are average conductors (medium resistance), and then ceramics, mica, and air are considered poor conductors (high resistance).

Ohm's Law defines the relationship between circuit attributes:

Resistance = Volts / Current

Resistance = Power / (Current^2)

A non-ohmic attribute of Resistance can also be defined as a function of noise voltage, as part of Noise Power = kTBf, where a resistor that is above absolute zero temperature is a source of noise.  When a resistor is combined with either a capacitor or inductor, the current through this network will be out of phase with the applied voltage, and described as displacement current. The combination of resistance with capacitance/inductance is known as impedance and complex mathematics is used to build on the basic ohm’s law shown above. 
 
**3.12 Wire**

A wire is a single, usually cylindrical, flexible strand or rod of metal. Wires are used to bear mechanical loads or electricity and telecommunications signals. Wire is commonly formed by drawing the metal through a hole in a die or draw plate. Wire gauges come in various standard sizes, as expressed in terms of a gauge number. The term wire is also used more loosely to refer to a bundle of such strands, as in "multistranded wire", which is more correctly termed a wire rope in mechanics, or a cable in electricity.

# CHAPTER 4: BASICS OF HARDWARE AND CIRCUITRY

**4.1 	Introduction**

This chapter includes the total working procedure and circuit diagram. Here we describe all about this project hardware and circuitry and all over the system applies here. 
 
**4.2 	Arduino Uno**

The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc. The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards (shields) and other circuits. The board has 14 digital I/O pins (six capable of PWM output), 6 analog I/O pins, and is programmable with the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), via a type B USB cable. It can be powered by the USB cable or by an external 9-volt battery, though it accepts voltages between 7 and 20 volts. It is similar to the Arduino Nano and Leonardo. The hardware reference design is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 2.5 license and is available on the Arduino website. Layout and production files for some versions of the hardware are also available.  The word "Uno" means "one" in Italian and was chosen to mark the initial release of Arduino Software. The Uno board is the first in a series of USB-based Arduino boards; it and version 1.0 of the Arduino IDE were the reference versions of Arduino, which have now evolved to newer releases. The ATmega328 on the board comes preprogrammed with a bootloader that allows uploading new code to it without the use of an external hardware programmer.

While the Uno communicates using the original STK500 protocol, it differs from all preceding boards in that it does not use the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip. Instead, it uses the Atmega16U2 (Atmega8U2 up to version R2) programmed as a USB-to-serial converter. 
 	 
**4.3 	Arduino Architecture**

Basically, the processor of the Arduino board uses the Harvard architecture where the program code and program data have separate memory. It consists of two memories such as program memory and data memory. Wherein the data is stored in data memory and the code is stored in the flash program memory. The Atmega328 microcontroller has 32kb of flash memory, 2kb of SRAM  1kb of EPROM and operates with a 16MHz clock speed.

❖	EEPROM is 1 KB   
❖	CLK Speed is 16 MHz   
   
*4.3.3  	Power*


The Arduino Uno can be powered via the USB connection or with an external power supply. The power source is selected automatically. External (non-USB) power can come either from an AC-toDC adapter (wall-wart) or battery. The adapter can be connected by plugging a 2.1mm center-positive plug into the board's power jack. Leads from a battery can be inserted in the GND and Vin pin headers of the POWER connector. The board can operate on an external supply of 6 to 20 volts. If supplied with less than 7V, however, the 5V pin may supply less than five volts and the board may be unstable. If using more than 12V, the voltage regulator may overheat and damage the board. The recommended range is 7 to 12 volts. The power pins are as follows: VIN. The input voltage to the Arduino board when it's using an external power source (as opposed to 5 volts from the USB connection or other regulated power source). You can supply voltage through this pin, or, if supplying voltage via the power jack, access it through this pin. 5V. This pin outputs a regulated 5V from the regulator on the board. The board can be supplied with power either from the DC power jack (7 - 12V), the USB connector (5V), or the VIN pin of the board (7-12V). Supplying voltage via the 5V or 3.3V pins bypasses the regulator, and can damage your board. We don't advise it. 3V3. A 3.3-volt supply generated by the on-board regulator. Maximum current draw is 50 mA. GND. Ground pins.   
 	 
*4.3.4 	Memory*

There are three pools of memory in the microcontroller used on avr-based Arduino boards: 

❖	Flash memory (program space), is where the Arduino sketch is stored. 
❖	SRAM (static random-access memory) is where the sketch creates and manipulates variables when it runs.   
❖	EEPROM is memory space that programmers can use to store long-term information.   Flash memory and EEPROM memory are non-volatile (the information persists after the power is turned off). SRAM is volatile and will be lost when the power is cycled. The ATmega328 chip found on the Uno has the following amounts of memory:   
❖	Flash 32k bytes (of which .5k is used for the bootloader)   
❖	SRAM   2k bytes   
❖	EEPROM 1k byte   
The ATmega2560 in the Mega2560 has larger memory space:   
❖	Flash 256k bytes (of which 8k is used for the bootloader)   
❖	SRAM   8k bytes   
❖	EEPROM 4k byte

Notice that there's not much SRAM available in the Uno. It's easy to use it all up by having lots of strings in your program. For example, a declaration like:   char message [] = "I support the Cape Wind project.";   puts 33 bytes into SRAM (each character takes a byte, plus the '\0' terminator). This might not seem like a lot, but it doesn't take long to get to 2048, especially if you have a large amount of text to send to a display, or a large lookup table, for example.

If you run out of SRAM, your program may fail in unexpected ways; it will appear to upload successfully, but not run, or run strangely. To check if this is happening, you can try commenting out or shortening the strings or other data structures in your sketch (without changing the code). If it then runs successfully, you're probably running out of SRAM.  There are a few things you can do to address this problem:

If your sketch talks to a program running on a (desktop/laptop) computer, you can try shifting data or calculations to the computer, reducing the load on the Arduino.

If you have lookup tables or other large arrays, use the smallest data type necessary to store the values you need; for example, an int takes up two bytes, while a byte uses only one (but can store a smaller range of values).

If you don't need to modify the strings or data while your sketch is running, you can store them in flash (program) memory instead of SRAM; to do this, use the PROGMEM keyword.

*4.3.5 Communication with Arduino*

Arduino can be used to communicate with a computer, another Arduino board or other microcontrollers. The ATmega328P microcontroller provides UART TTL (5V) serial communication which can be done using digital pin 0 (Rx) and digital pin 1 (TX). An ATmega16U2 on the board channels this serial communication over USB and appears as a virtual com port to software on the computer. The ATmega16U2 firmware uses the standard USB COM drivers, and no external driver is needed. However, on Windows, a .inf file is required. The Arduino software includes a serial monitor which allows simple textual data to be sent to and from the Arduino board. There are two RX and TX LEDs on the Arduino board which will flash when data is being transmitted via the USB-to-serial chip and USB connection to the computer (not for serial communication on pins 0 and 1). A Software Serial library allows for serial communication on any of the Uno's digital pins. The ATmega328P also supports I2C (TWI) and SPI communication. The Arduino software includes a Wire library to simplify use of the I2C bus. 
 
*4.3.6 Programming with Arduino*

The Arduino Uno can be programmed with the Arduino software (download). Select "Arduino Uno from the Tools > Board menu (according to the microcontroller on your board). For details, see the reference and tutorials. The ATmega328 on the Arduino Uno comes pre burned with a bootloader that allows you to upload new code to it without the use of an external hardware programmer. It communicates using the original STK500 protocol (reference, C header files). You can also bypass the bootloader and program the microcontroller through the ICSP (InCircuit Serial Programming) header; see these instructions for details. The ATmega16U2 (or 8U2 in the rev1 and rev2 boards) firmware source code is available. The ATmega16U2/8U2 is loaded with a DFU bootloader, which can be activated by:

❖	On Rev1 boards: connecting the solder jumper on the back of the board (near the map of Italy) and then resetting the 8U2.   
❖	On Rev2 or later boards: there is a resistor that pulling the 8U2/16U2 HWB line to ground, making it easier to put into DFU mode.

You can then use Atmel's FLIP software (Windows) or the DFU programmer (Mac OS X and Linux) to load a new firmware. Or you can use the ISP header with an external programmer (overwriting the DFU bootloader). See this user-contributed tutorial for more information.    
 
*4.3.7 Automatic (Software) Reset*

Rather than requiring a physical press of the reset button before an upload, the Arduino Uno is designed in a way that allows it to be reset by software running on a connected computer. One of the hardware flow control lines (DTR) of the ATmega8U2/16U2 is connected to the reset line of the ATmega328 via a 100 Nano farad capacitor. When this line is asserted (taken low), the reset line drops long enough to reset the chip. The Arduino software uses this capability to allow you to upload code by simply pressing the upload button in the Arduino environment. This means that the bootloader can have a shorter timeout, as the lowering of DTR can be wellcoordinated with the start of the upload. This setup has other implications. When the Uno is connected to either a computer running Mac OS X or Linux, it resets each time a connection is made to it from software (via USB). For the following half second or so, the bootloader is running on the Uno. While it is programmed to ignore malformed data (i.e. anything besides an upload of new code), it will intercept the first few bytes of data sent to the board after a connection is opened. If a sketch running on the board receives one-time configuration or other data when it first starts, make sure that the software with which it communicates waits a second after opening the connection and before sending this data. The Uno contains a trace that can be cut to disable the auto-reset. The pads on either side of the trace can be soldered together to renewable it. It's labeled "RESET-EN". You may also be able to disable the auto-reset by connecting a 110-ohm resistor from 5V to the reset line; see this forum thread for details.    
 
*4.3.8 Physical Characteristics*

The maximum length and width of the Uno PCB are 2.7 and 2.1 inches respectively, with the USB connector and power jack extending beyond the former dimension. Four screw holes allow the board to be attached to a surface or case. Note that the distance between digital pins 7 and 8 is 160 mils (0.16"), not even multiple of the 100-mil spacing of the other pins.  
 
*4.3.9 Input and Output*

Each of the 14 digital pins on the Uno can be used as an input or output, using pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and digitalRead() functions. They operate at 5 volts. Each pin can provide or receive a maximum of 40 mA and has an internal pull-up resistor (disconnected by default) of 20-50 kOhms. In addition, some pins have specialized functions: 

❖	Serial: 0 (RX) and 1 (TX). Used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data.

These pins are connected to the corresponding pins of the ATmega8U2 USB-toTTL 
Serial chip.  

❖	PWM: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. Provide 8-bit PWM output with the analogWrite() function.    
❖	SPI: 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), 13 (SCK). These pins support SPI communication using the SPI library.    
❖	LED: 13. There is a built-in LED connected to digital pin 13. When the pin is HIGH value, the LED is on, when the pin is LOW, it's off.    
The Uno has 6 analog inputs, labeled A0 through A5, each of which provide 10 bits of resolution (i.e. 1024 different values). By default they measure from ground to 5 volts, though is it possible to change the upper end of their range using the AREF pin and the analogReference() function. Additionally, some pins have specialized functionality:    
❖	TWI: A4 or SDA pin and A5 or SCL pin. Support TWI communication using the Wire library.    
There are a couple of other pins on the board:    
❖	AREF. Reference voltage for the analog inputs. Used with analogReference().   
❖	Reset. Bring this line LOW to reset the microcontroller. Typically used to add a reset button to shields which block the one on the board. 
 
*4.3.10 USB Overcurrent Protection*

The Arduino Uno has a resettable polyfuse that protects your computer's USB ports from shorts and overcurrent. Although most computers provide their own internal protection, the fuse provides an extra layer of protection. If more than 500 mA is applied to the USB port, the fuse will automatically break the connection until the short or overload is removed.  
 
*4.3.11 Arduino UNO Applications*

Arduino UNO has numerous applications in our everyday life. It's the most commonly used Microcontroller board. Few of its working fields are as follows:   
❖	Embedded Systems   
❖	Control Systems   
❖	Robotics   
❖	Instrumentation   
❖	Condition Monitoring   
So you must have got a picture of its uses. I must add it's just the tip of the iceberg and there's a lot we can do with this Microcontroller board. If you are having any trouble while working on it then ask in comments and I will help you out.

The Arduino Uno SMD is a version of the Arduino Uno but uses a surface mount version of the Arduino Uno instead of the through-hole version. This version was made in response to a shortage in supply of the through-hole Arduino Uno. The board is based on the ATmega328 (datasheet). It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with an AC to DC adapter or battery to get started.   The Uno differs from all preceding boards in that it does not use the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip. Instead, it features the Arduino Uno programmed as a USB-to-serial converter.   
"Uno" means one in Italian and is named to mark the upcoming release of Arduino 1.0. The Uno and version 1.0 will be the reference versions of Arduino, moving forward. The Uno is the latest in a series of USB Arduino boards, and the reference model for the Arduino platform; for a comparison with previous versions, see the index of Arduino boards.

The wiring of the device is done in the following manner. The Ground of the LED, buzzer, and vibration motor are connected to the GND of the Arduino. The +ve of the LED and the middle leg of the switch is connected to the Arduino VCC. The +ve of the Buzzer is wired to the first leg of the switch and the +ve of the Vibration motor is wired to the third leg of the switch.  
 
 
 
Fig 6.2: Final and Complete Design Construction of Project 
 	 
The Ultrasonic sensors are wired accordingly. The Ultrasonic sensor pin VCC is connected to the Arduino pin VCC, the Ultrasonic sensor pin GND is connected to the Arduino pin GND, the Ultrasonic sensor pin Trig is attached to the Arduino pin 12, the Ultrasonic sensor pin Echo is connected to the Arduino PIN 13. The switch used here is for selecting the mode. (Buzzer or vibration mode.) We first cut the pref board in 5 X 3 cm dimensions and solder the female headers for the Arduino to the board. Then soldering of the buzzer is carried out. Then using the glue connect the vibrating motor and solder the wires to it. Then connection of the LED is done. Then connect the switch. Connect the header pins for ultrasonic sensors and the battery input. Then solder all the things and connect the Arduino and ultrasonic sensor to the board. Also, connect the gloves to all the modules. For making the module for the hand, connect the ultrasonic sensor to the board by using 4 jumper cables. Then connect a 3.7-volt mobile battery to this module. Then connect the gloves. In the end, after all the connections are done to the Arduino board, upload the code to each Arduino board and power the 4 other modules using a power.transreceiver. 
 
The transmitter emits the US waves and if obstacles are present in the path, the US waves hits the obstacles and gets reflected back, the reflected wave is received by the receiver. The US sensor is a combination of one transmitter and receiver. The time interval between sending and receiving of the US signal is calculated, this time interval is used to calculate the distance between sensor and the equation for the distance calculation between the sensor and the object is as follows:  
D = (HPTW * SV)/2 Where, D = Distance in cm. HPTW = High time of pulse width. SV = Sound velocity in cm/s.  
 
The sensors which are put in midsection belt are in such a way, to the point that the Ultrasonic beats of sensors must not be covered one over the other. Sensors has a field of view (inclusion) of around 60 degrees for 4 feet remove, as the separation from the sensor expands, the inclusion edge diminishes.  
 
In this way, along these lines smart glove for Blind will be intended for the outwardly weakened individuals and will make it simple and advantageous as it will be a wearable gadget and therefore will help the client in voyaging and identifying the impediments while strolling effortlessly.

**6.4 	Result and Discussion**

The presented system is designed and configured for the use of the blind and visually impaired people. This device is able to handle several states that the visually impaired people face. This device responds to the user in all the circumstances which is faced by the blind people with the help of the use of the Ultrasonic sensors and the Arduino Board.

*Case 1:* When the obstacle or the object is in the front, the sensor senses the obstacle. 
*Case 2:* When it detects any obstacle then it will vibrate and active the buzzer to make sound. 
*Case 3:* When user presses the switch, device will track the location with GPS. 
*Case 4:* After tracking the location, a message will send to a message with location and a SOS message. 
 	  
# CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSION

**7.1 	Future Enhancement**

The entire project can be made in the form of jacket, so that the device doesn't need to be wear one by one. By specifically suing the specialized boards that are designed, using them instead of Arduino and also by using high quality ultrasonic sensors makes and gives faster response which make the device capable of working in crowded places and thus this will be implemented in the future enhancement of this device. 
 
**7.2 	Conclusion**

Smart glove for the blind project is to help blind people walk and estimate the distance from obstacles. Main component for this project is Arduino UNO, Vibrator motor and ultrasonic sensor. Based on the experiment that has been conducted, there are few advantages and limitations of this project. One of the advantages of this project was the use of ultrasonic sensor. This sensor was very sensitive and will trigger faster when it detects obstacles. Besides that, the cost to develop this project was low and can be afforded by blind people. The limitation of this project was the ultrasonic sensor used can only detect the obstacles but cannot illustrate the shape of the obstacles. Furthermore, this assistive glove can only be used by blind people but not the blind and deaf people.

Thus, this project proposed the design and architecture of a new concept of Arduino based Virtual Eye for the blind people. A simple, cheap, efficient, easy to carry, configurable, easy to handle electronic guidance system with many more amazing properties and advantages is proposed to provide constructive assistant and support for the blind and visually impaired persons. The system will be efficient and unique in its capability in specifying the source and distance of the objects that may encounter the blind. It is able to scan and detect the obstacles in the areas like left, right, and in front of the blind person regardless of its height or depth. With the proposed architecture, if constructed with at most accuracy, the blind will be able to move from one place to another without others help. The proposed mix of different working units makes a continuous framework that screens position of the client and gives double input making route increasingly protected and secure. With the proposed architecture, if constructed with at most accuracy, the blind will be able to move from one place to another without others help. The project as a whole was successful in developing a more durable navigation technique apart from the existing ones. This was just a prototype of the original idea that had to be presented here. The project, if used on a wider scale and distributed to blind people, really has the ability to make an impact to the community.
